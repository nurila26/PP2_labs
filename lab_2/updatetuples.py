#Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its values. Tuples are unchangeable, or immutable as it also is called.
#But there is a workaround. You can convert the tuple into a list, change the list, and convert the list back into a tuple.
x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = list(x)
y[1] = "kiwi"
x = tuple(y)

print(x)

#Create a new tuple with the value "orange", and add that tuple:
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = ("orange",)
thistuple += y

print(thistuple)
